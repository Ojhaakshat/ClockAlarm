# ClockAlarm
Used HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript to make an Analog Clock with Alarm Setting and Stopping functionality. It also automatically picks your geospatial coordinates as longitude and latitude and uses openWeather Api to give all sorts of latest Weather updates.
A browser extension for the same has been made and tested on Google Chrome and Firefox.

> 1) Download the v2.0 version of code.  
> 2) Go to Chrome extensions, and turn on developers mode.  
> 3) Click on Load unpacked and browse through your file system to add the downloaded code.   

Hurray!! The extension has been added to your browser. Go to the top left extensions option and click on the ClockWeatherAlarm extension and enjoy.
